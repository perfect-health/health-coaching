        What is healthy weight loss?
        Senior couple jogging in a park

        It’s natural for anyone trying to lose weight to want to lose it very quickly.
        But people who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week)
        are more successful at keeping weight off. Healthy weight loss isn’t just about a
        “diet” or “program”. It’s about an ongoing lifestyle that includes long-term changes
        in daily eating and exercise habits.

        Once you’ve achieved a healthy weight, rely on healthy eating and physical activity
        to help you keep the weight off over the long term.

        Losing weight is not easy, and it takes commitment.
        But if you’re ready to get started,
        we’ve got a step-by-step guide to help get you on the road to weight loss and better
        health.
        Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits

        Even a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total
        body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as
        improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.1

        For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, a 5 percent weight
        loss equals 10 pounds, bringing your weight down to 190 pounds.
        While this weight may still be in the “overweight” or “obese” range, this modest weight loss can decrease your
        risk factors for chronic diseases related to obesity.

        So even if the overall goal seems large, see it as a journey
        rather than just a final destination. You’ll learn new eating and
        physical activity habits that will help you live a healthier lifestyle.
        These habits may help you maintain your weight loss over time.

        For example, the National Weight Control Registryexternal icon noted
        that study participants who maintained a significant weight loss reported
        improvements in physical health as well as energy levels, physical mobility,
        general mood, and self-confidence.
