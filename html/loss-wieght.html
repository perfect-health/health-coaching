          However, keep in mind that there are many problems with the BMI scale, which only looks at weight and height.
          It does not take muscle mass into account.

          Some people are naturally very skinny but still healthy. Being underweight according to this scale does not
          necessarily mean that you have a health problem.

          Being underweight is about 2–3 times more common among girls and women, compared to men. In the US, 1% of men
          and 2.4% of women 20 years and older are underweight (2Trusted Source).

          Summary

          Being underweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5. It’s much more common in women and
          girls.

          What Are the Health Consequences of Being Underweight?

          Obesity is currently one of the world’s biggest health problems.

          However, being underweight may be just as bad for your health. According to one study, being underweight was
          associated with a 140% greater risk of early death in men, and 100% in women (3Trusted Source).

          In comparison, obesity was associated with a 50% greater risk of early death, indicating that being
          underweight may be even worse for your health (3Trusted Source).

          Another study found an increased risk of early death in underweight men, but not women, suggesting that being
          underweight may be worse for men (4Trusted Source).

          Being underweight can also impair your immune function, raise your risk of infections, lead to osteoporosis
          and fractures and cause fertility problems (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).

          What’s more, people who are underweight are much more likely to get sarcopenia (age-related muscle wasting)
          and may be at greater risk of dementia (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).

          Summary

          Being underweight can be just as unhealthy as being obese — if not more. People who are underweight are at
          risk of osteoporosis, infections, fertility problems and early death.

          Several Things Can Cause Someone to Become Underweight

          There are several medical conditions that can cause unhealthy weight loss, including:

          Eating disorders: This includes anorexia nervosa, a serious mental disorder.
          Thyroid problems: Having an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can boost metabolism and cause unhealthy
          weight loss.
          Celiac disease: The most severe form of gluten intolerance. Most people with celiac disease don’t know that
          they have it (10Trusted Source).
          Diabetes: Having uncontrolled diabetes (mainly type 1) can lead to severe weight loss.
          Cancer: Cancerous tumors often burn large amounts of calories and can cause someone to lose a lot of weight.
          Infections: Certain infections can cause someone to become severely underweight. This includes parasites,
          tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.

          If you’re underweight, you may want to see a doctor to rule out any serious medical conditions.

          This is particularly important if you have recently started losing large amounts of weight without even
          trying.

          Summary

          There are several medical conditions that can cause unhealthy weight loss. If you’re underweight, see a doctor
          to rule out a serious health problem.

          How to Gain Weight the Healthy Way

          If you want to gain weight, it’s very important to do it right.

          Binging on soda and donuts may help you gain weight, but it can destroy your health at the same time.

          If you’re underweight, you want to gain a balanced amount of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat rather than a
          lot of unhealthy belly fat.

          There are plenty of normal-weight people who get type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other health problems
          often associated with obesity (11Trusted Source).

          Therefore, it’s absolutely essential to eat healthy foods and live an overall healthy lifestyle.

          The next chapter looks at several effective ways to gain weight fast, without ruining your health at the same
          time.
