    <p><h4>5 Things You Didn’t Know Water Could Do for You</h4> 
        Our bodies are made up of around 60 percent water—the most important nutrient you consume each day. Daily we lose water from our bodies through perspiration, urination and bowel movements. It’s vital to overall health to replace this lost water to avoid health consequences.

        Depending on your gender, weight and activity levels, the amount of water you need to replenish may differ. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of water/beverages a day and women need about 9 cups (2.2 liters). Heavier people and people who exercise a lot both need more than the average amount of water.
        
        Whatever your intake should be, aim to exceed it. There are an abundance of health benefits, some of which are unexpected, to drinking plenty of water. For instance, here are five things you probably didn’t know water can do for you:
